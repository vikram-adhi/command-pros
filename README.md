# Command Retrieval System with Generative AI (GenAI)

## Overview

In today's fast-paced and technology-dependent world, efficiently managing a growing number of commands and instructions for various tasks is a challenge. The traditional methods of memorizing or referencing commands can be time-consuming, error-prone, and counterproductive. This project proposes the utilization of Generative AI (GenAI) to simplify command retrieval and reduce the cognitive load associated with remembering specific instructions.

## Features

- **Command Retrieval:** Use Generative AI to generate commands based on user input.
- **Reduced Cognitive Load:** Simplify the process of recalling and executing commands for individual applications/OS.
